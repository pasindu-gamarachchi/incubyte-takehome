Hello Incubyte team,

Once the required files have been cloned locally.

The main file can be run using the following command:
`python Hospital_Database_System.py`

The test file can be run using the following command:
`python -m unittest test_Hospital_Database_System.py`

A requirements.txt file is added for completion. No external libaries are used as I decided to use sqlite3 for the database.
